<dl>
<dt><a name="filter_type">Filter Type</a></dt>
<dd>
Type of the filter.
Lowpass filter, highpass filter, bandpass filter, and bandstop filter can be used.
</dd>

<dt><a name="hp_cutoff">Highpass Cutoff</a></dt>
<dd>
Normalized cut-off frequency of a highpass filter.
  1.0 means the Nyquist frequency (half of sampling frequency).
Bigger value makes the wider frequency region cut off.
The cutoff frequency in Hz is displayed in the drawing area on the left side of this dialog.

This cutoff frequency must be lower in the bandpass filter case,
higher in the bandstop filter case than <a href="#lp_cutoff">the lowpass cutoff</a>.

</dd>

<dt><a name="lp_cutoff">Lowpass Cutoff</a></dt>
<dd>
Normalized cut-off frequency of a lowpass filter.
  1.0 means the Nyquist frequency (half of sampling frequency).
  Smaller value makes the wider frequency region cut off.
The cutoff frequency in Hz is displayed in the drawing area on the left side of this dialog.

This cutoff frequency must be higher in the bandpass filter case
lower in the bandstop filter case than <a href="#hp_cutoff">the highpass cutoff</a>.
</dd>

<dt><a name="sidelobe">Sidelobe</a></dt>
<dd>
Sidelobe height of filters.
This parameter gives an amount of attenuation lower/higher than the cut-off
frequency. A bigger value makes the amount of attenuation bigger.
However, the bigger value sometimes requires more CPU power.
</dd>

<dt><a name="transition">Transition</a></dt>
<dd>
  Transition frequency width for filters in normalized frequency.
  1.0 means the Nyquist frequency.
  The bigger value makes the filters having more gentle slope.
</dd>
