<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2> 

<p>
spwave is an audio file editor supporting several sound formats including
WAV, AIFF, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, raw, and more. The program is designed for
research use, so stability and usability are regarded as important. spwave
runs on multiple platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

<h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2> 

<p>
spwave has following features.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Support for multiple platforms: Windows, Mac OS, Linux (Motif, gtk), etc.
<li> Support for WAV, AIFF, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, raw, and text files by using plug-ins.
<li> Support for many bits/samples: 8bits, 16bits, 24bits, 32bits, 32bits float, 64bits double.
<li> Converting the sampling frequency and the bits/sample of a file.
<li> Playing, zooming, cropping, deleting, extracting, etc. of a selected region.
<li> Fade-in, fade-out, gain adjustment, channel swapping, etc of a selected region.
<li> Editing file information that supports comments of WAV and AIFF, and ID3 tag of MP3.
<li> Analysis of a selected region using several analysis types,
  e.g. spectrum, smoothed spectrum, phase, unwrapped phase and group delay.
<li> Undoing and redoing without limitation of the number of times.
<li> Waveform extraction by drag &amp; drop.

<li> Opening files by drag &amp; drop.
<li> Autosaving of selected regions (you can do this by drag &amp; drop also).
<li> Saving positions and regions as labels.
<li> Viewing some waveforms and setting regions synchronously.
<li> Almost all processing is 64 bits processing internally.
</ul>

<h2><a name="install">Install</a></h2> 

<p>
On Windows and Mac OS, you can install spwave just by unpacking the archive.
However, if you want to move the executable to another folder, you have to
move plug-ins with it. If you don't do that, spwave can load no files.
Linux version requires installing plug-ins (spPlugin 0.8.2 or higher) before
installing spwave. Using RPM version (for Redhat-based Linux) or deb version (for
Debian-based Linux) is easier way.
</p>
<p>
Uninstallation can be simply done by removing files. You can remove the
files safely because spwave doesn't use the registry and doesn't replace system files.
If you installed RPM/deb version on Linux, you should uninstall it based on
the usage of RPM/deb.
</p>

<p>
To compile the source code on Linux/Unix, see <a href="compile.html">How to compile</a>.
</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="platforms">Supported Platforms</a></h2> 

<p>
spwave is known to work at least on Windows XP/Vista/7, Mac OS 10.4/10.6, 
and Linux (Redhat, Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.).
</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2> 

<p>
A level meter introduced from version 0.6.7 does not display exact amplitude.
</p>

<p>
Although support of ASIO driver is added in version 0.6.11-2b, ``ASIO
Multimedia Driver'' doesn't work well. Please use an ASIO driver of an ASIO
supported device. Since ``ASIO Multimedia Driver'' is used for non-ASIO
devices, you probably don't suffer from that practically.
</p>

<p>
Window scrolling in Windows Media Audio file which is supported by version
0.6.12-4b does not work correctly (the time position does not coincide 
with the actual time line). It has not been clarified yet if the problem 
is caused by the Microsoft's library or my implementation. If you have 
trouble with the problem, please save the file as the WAV format.
</p>

<p>
Mac OS X (Carbon) version has a bug that right-click of a mouse doesn't work
correctly on the waveform overview display. Mac OS X Cocoa version doesn't
have this problem.
</p>

<h2><a name="bug_report">Bug Report</a></h2> 

<p>
If you have questions or find bugs, please send me an e-mail. Please include
the following information when you report bugs.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Version of spwave (or the file name of the downloaded archive)
<li> Version of the operating system  (e.g. Windows XP SP2, Mac OS X 10.6.8, etc.)
<li> Symptoms in delail
<li> Version of the plugin if the bug is associated with a particular file. 
   e.g. the bug is related to writing MP3 files.
</ul>
<p>
Including `spwave' in the subject of the e-mail is also helpful for me.
</p>

<p>
I have received many e-mails related to saving as MP3. The function saving as
MP3 is turned off as default to avoid the license and patent related problems
of MP3. To turn on the function, you have to download and install the MP3
output plugin. Please download and install the plugin if your condition
agrees with the condition at the official site.
</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="license">License</a></h2> 

<p>
spwave is free software. Please see LICENSE.txt included in the archive
for more information.
