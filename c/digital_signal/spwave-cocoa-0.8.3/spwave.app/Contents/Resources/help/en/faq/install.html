<dt><a name="install">How do I install spwave?</a>
<dd>
  On Windows and Mac OS, you can install spwave just by unpacking the archive.
  Easiest way on Linux is to install RPM version (for Redhat-based Linux) or
  deb version (for Debian-based Linux). 
  Linux version from version 0.5 requires installing plug-ins before installing spwave.
  <br>
  If you want to compile it from source code, you need libraries of spBase, spAudio
  spComponent, spLib and spPlugin. These libraries are part of <a href="http://www-is.meijo-u.ac.jp/labs/rj001/spLibs/index.html"
  target="_top">spLibs</a>. If you failed the compilation, make sure that you
  are using GNU make (but I heard that some versions of GNU make also would
  fail in installation). For more information about compilation, see <a
  href="../about/compile.html">this page</a>.
  
<dt><a name="uninstall">How do I uninstall spwave?</a>
<dd> All you need to do is removing the installed files. You can remove the
  files safely because spwave doesn't use the registry and doesn't replace system files.
  If you installed RPM/deb version on Linux, you have to uninstall it based on
  the usage of RPM/deb.
