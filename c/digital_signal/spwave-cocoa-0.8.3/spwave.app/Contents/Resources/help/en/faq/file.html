<dt><a name="mp3_output">I can't find the output plug-in for MP3. </a>
<dd> 
  I don't include the output plug-in in the spwave package and don't
  distribute the binary version of the output plug-in to avoid patent-related
  problems. If you live in Japan, you can download it at <a
  href="http://www-is.meijo-u.ac.jp/labs/rj001/spLibs/spwave/download-j.html">Japanese
  page</a> for research or educational use. Of cource, the page is written in
  Japanese :-) 
<br>[From version 0.5]
  
<dt><a name="longfile">Very long files cannot be loaded. Why?</a>
<dd> Because spwave will load all data in memory until version 0.4.
  If an amount of memory is not sufficient, the data cannot be loaded.
  <br>[Until version 0.4]
  <br>
  Version 0.5 supports loading very long files. Conversely, all files are
  loaded from files directly. So, spwave may be crushed, if you modify the
  file that has been loaded by spwave.
  <br>[From version 0.5]

<dt><a name="file_read">No files can be loaded. Why?<a/>
<dd> spwave from version 0.5 uses plug-ins for reading and writing files.
  If the plug-ins provided by <a href="http://www-is.meijo-u.ac.jp/labs/rj001/spLibs/index.html#spPlugin" 
  target="_top">spPlugin</a> is not installed correctly, spwave cannot read
  and write files at all. In this case, you should install spPlugin into
  the proper directory.
  The plug-ins also doesn't work, if the version of `libc' of the plug-ins is
  different from that of spwave on Linux, or the version of the plug-ins is too old.
  <br>
  
  spwave searches for plug-ins 
  <code>~/.sp_plugins</code>, <code>/usr/lib/sp/plugins</code>,
  <code>/usr/local/lib/sp/plugins</code>
  in this order. The <code>~/</code> on Windows and Mac OS means the directory that
  the executable binary is holded. If <code>HOMEPATH</code> on Window or
  <code>HOME</code> on Mac OS is set, the directory is also searched.
